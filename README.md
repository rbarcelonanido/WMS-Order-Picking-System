# WMS-Order-Picking-System

Common issue reported from employees: 
- System allows employee to pick lighter items before heavy items.
- This causes for inefficient order building and requires the employee to spend more time rebuilding the order.
- It is more efficient to pick heavy items first to build a strong foundation followed by adding lighter items on top.

This program simulates an order picking system where items are picked from heaviest to lightest.
