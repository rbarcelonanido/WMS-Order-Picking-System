# WMS-Order-Picking-System

Common issues reported within order picking systems: 
- Application allows for picking lighter items before heavy items.
- This causes for inefficient pallet building and requires the employee to spend more time rebuilding the order.
- It is more efficient to pick heavy items first to build a strong foundation followed by adding lighter items on top.

This program simulates an order picking system where items are picked from heaviest to lightest.
